## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

1. **Port already in use**

   ```bash
   # Check what's using port 3000
   lsof -i :3000

   # Stop existing containers
   ./deploy.sh stop
   ```

2. **Docker build fails**

   ```bash
   # Clean up Docker cache
   docker system prune -a

   # Rebuild without cache
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```

3. **Container won't start**

   ```bash
   # Check container logs
   docker-compose logs

   # Check container status
   docker-compose ps
   ```

### Common Issues

1. **Database errors**

   ```bash
   # Remove Docker volume to reset database
   docker-compose down -v
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Module not found errors**

   ```bash
   # Rebuild Docker image
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```

3. **Permission issues**

   ```bash
   # Fix file permissions
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ```
